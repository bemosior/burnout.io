You can also find others you can talk to who have gone through similar experiences. There are people at conferences, on `Reddit <http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/search?q=burnout&sort=top&restrict_sr=on>`_ , on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/search?q=burnout&src=typd>`_ , and maybe even at your workplace who know what you are going through and can help.
