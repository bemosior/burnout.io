A quick note if you're adding a new heading:  

Sphinx will error out if your title text is longer than the title underline. For example:
``/projects/burnout.io/resources.rst:12: WARNING: Title underline too short.``

And when you look at the title, you see:

.. code-block:: rst

    This title is quite long...
    -----

Which will cause the error. Corrected, the tite would be more like:

.. code-block:: rst

    This title is quite long...
    -----------------------------------

Which will correct the issue.  For any other issues you run into, hop into the Gitter channel and one of us will help out.
